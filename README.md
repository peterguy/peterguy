ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @peterguy

Iâ€™ve been a software engineer and general man-about-town in related fields for over two decades. Put that way, I should be better at this stuff than I am. :-)

After spending most of those years bending Java to my will, Iâ€™ve moved on to writing mostly in Go, with a growing amount of TypeScript + React (and increasingly, SvelteKit) work thrown in. I still enjoy a good shell script, and Python is my go-to for personal hacking and automation.

These days, I lead teams at Sourcegraph, where Iâ€™ve managed the Code Search and Cody AI product groups building tools that make developers (myself included) more effective.

While I've been on macOS and Linux for awhile, I have spent time on the Dark Side: VB, C#, .NET VB, and more batch and PowerShell than Iâ€™d like to admit. Iâ€™ve wrestled with SOAP and XML (we all have scars), and these days stick mostly to REST and JSON. My web work leans toward API and behavior design, though I can hold my own with front-end layout when needed.

Back in the day, I started out as a systems and network administrator - back when moving from an ISDN to a T1 felt like a big day. I built desktops (RIP Fryâ€™s), managed Windows NT, wrangled PBXs, and later worked with Cisco, Oracle, and a zoo of OSes: Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, macOS, and Windows. Iâ€™ve been using Docker, Kubernetes, and other containerization tools for a while, though Iâ€™ll still claim early credit for working with chroot and FreeBSD jails.

Outside of work, I have a big, noisy life: a passel of children, too many pets, some livestock, and a garden thatâ€™s always just a bit too ambitious.
