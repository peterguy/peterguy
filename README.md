ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @peterguy

I have been a software engineer and general man-about-town in related fields for over two decades. Now that I think about it, I should be better at this stuff than I am. :-)

While I spent the better part of two decades bending Java to my will, now I do most of my work in Go and an increasing amount in Typescript/React.

I still do love me some shell script, and Python is my go-to for most of my personal hacking.

I find myself using [Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody) to speed up my programming, which is looking more and more like me telling Cody what I need and modifying the results.

I've dabbled regularly on the Dark Side with classic VB back in the day (cut my teeth on VB DLLs), and now C# and some .Net VB, along with a little Windows batch scripting as I can get away with, and some scattered PowerShell. I had my time with SOAP and XML, to my chagrin, but have also done my share of REST and JSON. When it comes to web work, I can keep up with design and layout, but find my expertise in designing APIs and programming behaviors. To that end, I have used JavaScript, PHP, Java Servlets, and on occasion C#.

In addition to my software development experience, I have also spent time in the BOFH arena. I started out as a systems/network administrator, in fact, before graduating to a VB DLL programmer. Moved the company from an ISDN to a T1, come to think of it, along with building desktop machines (R.I.P. Fry's), managing Windows NT boxen, and figuring out the PBX. I have continued to work with various systems and technologies along the way, from Cisco to Oracle (database, Forms, WebLogic), and with Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OSX, MacOS, and, inevitably, Windows. Docker and other virtualization/containerization technologies, such as Triton datacenter and Kubernetes, are more recent technologies for me. I was, however, familiar with and using chroot and jails in FreBSD before that, which counts for something, right?

Whew, well, that sounds like I do nothing but eat, sleep, and breathe programming! Well, yeah: who else would be writing so much about themselves on GitHub? As unlikely as it seems, I do have a quite full life outside of my software interests. I have a passel of children, too many pets, some livestock, and a garden that is always too big to manage.
